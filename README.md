# VSPS

This is a design for a power supply board and casing for the [VSPS (Very Simple Phono Stage)](http://phonoclone.com/diy-pho5.html) from RJM Audio.

Includes PCB design for power supply board, ready-to-print and CAD files for casing and adapter plates for both power supply unit
and main unit.

## Main Unit

### Main unit BOM

You'll want a VSPS kit (or source your own) from RJM Audio: <http://phonoclone.com/pcb.html>

Connectors/receptacles BOM for the enclosure unit as designed: <https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=c72ca91d05>

Then you'll want an enclosure. The CAD files have been designed for [this case](http://phonoclone.com/pcb.html) (the same one as for the power unit).

### CAD

## Power Supply Unit

### Power supply BOM

Electronic parts BOM: <https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=cfbaef526f>

Also, you'll need an enclosure. It is designed to work in this enclosure: <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HBT2CGK>

You'll need to sand down the sides of the PCB slightly at which point it will be a nice pressure fit into the PCB groove built into that enclosure.
